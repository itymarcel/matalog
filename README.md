# matalog

Matalog has the ambition of crowdsourcing a global repository of material information to create an open access material library that houses the profiles of materials used by architects, builders, designers, makers, artists and artisans around the world.

# alpha

This is the development of an alpha version that will support creating and accessing materials. It is part of a research quest to iterate on a material profile standard that will eventually become the foundation for a global network of community curated materials.
